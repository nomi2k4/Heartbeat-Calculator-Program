Heartbeat Calculator Program:
This C++ program was written as part of my learning journey to understand the basics of C++ programming. The program calculates the approximate number of heartbeats in 2 years based on the user's input.

Program Overview:

- Displays the average human heartbeat in 2 years
- Prompts the user to input their heart rate per second
- Calculates the approximate number of heartbeats in 2 years by multiplying the heart rate by the number of seconds in 2 years
- Displays the result

Features:

- User input for heart rate per second
- Use of multiplication operator for heartbeat calculation
- Clear and informative output

How to Run the Program:

1. Copy the provided C++ code into a .cpp file
2. Compile the program using a C++ compiler
3. Run the compiled program:
    - On Linux/macOS: ./heartbeat_calculator
    - On Windows: heartbeat_calculator.exe
4. Enter your heart rate per second when prompted

Learning Objectives:

- Understanding basic user input and output
- Using integer variables and arithmetic operators
- Working with basic calculations and conversions
- Basic program structure and syntax
